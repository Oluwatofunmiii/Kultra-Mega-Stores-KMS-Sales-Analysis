## Results/ Findings
### Key Insights
**Technology** was the top selling Product Category

Majority of **bottom 10 customers** belong to the small business segment and targeted offers or bundles may increase their lifetime value.

**Express Air** is the fastest and most expensive shipping method and was often used for low-priority orders whilst the slowest being **Delivery Truck** was used for high priority orders. This suggests cost inefficiencies and does not appropriately align with order priority. 

**West** Region had the highest sales.


## Recommendations
- Improve shipping alignment with order priority to cut costs.
- Focus marketing on best-selling product categories in top-performing regions.
- Target bottom-tier customers with loyalty incentives.
